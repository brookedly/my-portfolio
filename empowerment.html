						<p>Diversity in tech is a hot topic throughout the world. Therefore, I am a strong advocate for diversity in tech - whether to you that means culturally or gender specific. I am currently a  member in WICS (Women In Computer Science) club on campus as well as an ICS/BRAID Scholarship recipient that allowed me to attend the 2017 Grace Hopper Conference. Recently, I participated in an outreach workshop called igniteCS which focused on educating the younger generation the importance of the growing field of technology. As said by Apple and other American tech companies "diversity makes us stronger."</p>

						<p>Before watching this film, I wasn't aware of how beef was being produced and how much of an impact consumption factors into one's health and the world. Beinging a meat eater originally, I wasn't excited about watching the film. But once I started watching more and more vegan YouTubers, I became more open toward the idea of it. Eventually, I watched it. Although I am not an extremeist when it comes to veganism - I do highly encourage people to educate themselves of where and how their source of food is coming from and how it may effect multiple area of a person's live.</p>

						<p>This film is a sequel to Cowspiracy that focuses more on the correlation between diet and health. I was actually reccommended by an uncle of mine to watch this film. Although I am not an extremeist when it comes to veganism/etc. I do highly encourage people to educate themselves of where and how their source of food is coming from and how it may effect multiple area of a person's live.
						Don't take this personally - everyone is allowed their own opinion - 
						*Disclaimer I am not telling you how to live your life but just purely as knowledge to know how the diet you have can affect your health.
