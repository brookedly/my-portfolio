						<p>Diversity in tech is a hot topic throughout the world. Being a women in tech, I am a strong advocate for diversity in tech - whether to you that means culturally or gender specific. I am currently a  member in WICS (Women In Computer Science) club on campus as well as an ICS/BRAID Scholarship recipient that allowed me to attend the 2017 Grace Hopper Conference. Recently, I participated in an outreach workshop called igniteCS which focused on educating the younger generation the importance of the growing field of technology. As said by Apple and other American tech companies "diversity makes us stronger."</p>

						<p>Before watching this film, I wasn't aware of the impact that can be imposed by cattle agriculture into one's health and the world. Beinging a meat eater originally, I wasn't excited about watching the film. But once I started educating myself with research articles and watching vegan YouTubers, I became more open toward the idea of it. Eventually, I watched it. Although I am not an extremeist when it comes to the topic of  - I do highly encourage people to educate themselves of where and how their source of food is coming from and how it may effect multiple area of a person's life.</p>

						<p>Watching this film definitely gives the say "don't take anything for granted" a whole new meaning. A group of four men in the film are challenged to live on $1 per day in rural and impoverished Guatmemala. For two months they struggle with malnutrition, sickness, and parasites. This film is absolutely remarkable. While pulling at your heartstrings, it sheds light on the various problems that are happening throughout the world such as how harshly people have to do in order to live. Ultimately, despite the hardships that I've had endured or will endure, will never compare to the billions who may have it worst. As people, we need to come together to help make the world a better place. </p>

						<p>This film is a sequel to Cowspiracy that focuses more on the correlation between diet and health. I was actually reccommended by an uncle of mine to watch this film. Although I am not an extremeist when it comes to veganism/etc. I do highly encourage people to educate themselves of where and how their source of food is coming from and how it may effect multiple area of a person's live.
						Don't take this personally - everyone is allowed their own opinion - 
						*Disclaimer I am not telling you how to live your life but just purely as knowledge to know how the diet you have can affect your health.
